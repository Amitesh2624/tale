A close friend of mine once remarked 'Philosophy is dead', paraphrasing words from the great physicist Stephen Hawking, widely known in the community for his work on the Hawking Radiation and science books. While another one routinely sends me tweets from Elon Musk and Neil deGrasse Tyson sharing same but more hurtful sentiments. As a humanities and scienc enthusiast, these opinions from pioneers of STEM make me sick to the stomach.

While doing some research on equitable vaccination distribution and data privacy in COVID times, I learneed just how important a nuanched understanding of Science and Humanities is for responsible and effective policy making. It is this ignorance on the part of the Software Engineers at Facebook, and the policy makers of the US(and other countries) that we owe such grave compromise of contemporary privacy to. I wish to impart my multi-disciplinary opinions on various politics, economics and tech related fields via the means of this blog. I would be glad if you learn something new from my posts!

Thanks for reading!
