As people of my high-school class get closer and closer to applying to colleges, I have been witnessing a rise in opinions against Affirmative Action around me. This is possibly
because my friends aim to justify their possible (and probable) failure in the process by means of invalidating other students from different communities. I believe I have relevant experience when it comes to debunking anti-reservation or affirmative action arguments, simply because of the countless number of times I find myself amidst an affirmative-action diss-show. In this post, I'll be building on some things that anti-reservation folks can think about.

We need to get a few facts straight. We need to realize that income inequality amongst different castes is a real phenomenon. This will help us understand the actual extent of 
marginalisation in India. Business Standard reports that [top 10% upper caste households own 60% wealth](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/income-inequality-in-india-top-10-upper-caste-households-own-60-wealth-119011400105_1.html#:~:text=Inequality%20between%20castes&text=SC%20and%20ST%20households%20earn,than%20the%20annual%20Indian%20average.). Furthermore, the wealthiest upper-caste households grew the extent of their wealth by 16% in the years 2012 to 2019 whereas, the average SC household was only able to increase its wealth by a mere 2%. Though education levels for the disadvantaged castes have been rising, they still reflect a [noteworthy gap in comparison to the general caste category](https://theprint.in/opinion/education-levels-of-sc-st-obc-rising-a-new-study-looks-at-caste-gap-in-jobs-income-too/606200/).

## Caste-based Statistics:
- Ownership of autonomous economic establishments follow the caste hierarchy.
- Upper-caste people are the most likely to be employed in formal white-collar jobs.
- Economic well-being, a statistic that includes financial conditions, accesibility to ammenities among other factors show that SCs and STs are most likely to be poor.
