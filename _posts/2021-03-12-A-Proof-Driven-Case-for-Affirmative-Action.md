As people of my high-school class get closer and closer to applying to colleges, I have been witnessing a rise in opinions against Affirmative Action around me. This is possibly
because my friends aim to justify their possible (and probable) failure in the process by means of invalidating other students from different communities. I believe I have relevant experience when it comes to debunking anti-reservation or affirmative action arguments, simply because of the countless number of times I find myself amidst an affirmative-action diss-show. In this post, I'll be building on some things that anti-reservation folks can think about.
<br>

We need to get a few facts straight. We need to realize that income inequality amongst different castes is a real phenomenon. This will help us understand the actual extent of 
marginalisation in India. Business Standard reports that [top 10% upper caste households own 60% wealth](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/income-inequality-in-india-top-10-upper-caste-households-own-60-wealth-119011400105_1.html#:~:text=Inequality%20between%20castes&text=SC%20and%20ST%20households%20earn,than%20the%20annual%20Indian%20average.). Furthermore, the wealthiest upper-caste households grew the extent of their wealth by 16% in the years 2012 to 2019 whereas, the average SC household was only able to increase its wealth by a mere 2%. Though education levels for the disadvantaged castes have been rising, they still reflect a [noteworthy gap in comparison to the general caste category](https://theprint.in/opinion/education-levels-of-sc-st-obc-rising-a-new-study-looks-at-caste-gap-in-jobs-income-too/606200/).

## Caste-based Statistics:
- Ownership of autonomous economic establishments follow the caste hierarchy.
- Upper-caste people are the most likely to be employed in formal white-collar jobs.
- Economic well-being, a statistic that includes financial conditions, accesibility to ammenities among other factors show that SCs and STs are most likely to be poor.

So, now we have established that the people from the scheduled castes are indeed economically in a much weaker capacity than the general category people. We also know that biologically, there is no difference between the two categories. Afterall, caste is but a social construct. So what then, is causing this marginalisation? And more importantly,
how do we fix it? The answer isn't as straightforward as one might like it to be, infact questions like these are so complex and involve so many societal forces, sociologists spend their entire life tackling them. However, we can get an idea of the depth of discrimination with a hypothesis as follows:
<br>

Suppose there is a particular Dalit family and a corresponding General category family in the early 20th century. The Dalit movement is in full-swing and so is the proliferation of education. People are starting to attend institutes to further their prospects in the global world. In the initial phases, the general category gets a headstart, it sends its kids to good institutes whereas caste-based discrimination isn't legally abolished yet, and so the kids of the dalit family are left with their labour based jobs. Suppose im the future, after the declaration of India's independence and its subsequent constitution, we compare the two families. Technically speaking, they are both granted *equal opportunities* as per the law of the land, but are they really? The general category household now knows the value of education, its consequent generations will get the best ammenities in the metropolitans of India whereas the Dalit kids would have to start 100 or 200 or 300 years late. This is exactly what affirmative action aims to tackle. It aims to accelerate the catching up process.
<br>

That is it for this post, I hope it was intelecutally stimulating and at the very least helped the anti-affirmative action folks get an understanding of where the idea of reservation comes from.
