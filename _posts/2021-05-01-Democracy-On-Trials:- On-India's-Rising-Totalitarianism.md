_Democratic Proceedings in Greece_

The Economist Intelligence Unit annually releases a report that ranks different countries on the sanctity of their democratic systems. From 2014 to 2020, India has witnessed a steady decline in its ranking, dropping down from 27th in 2014 to 53rd in 2020. (https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-falls-to-53rd-position-in-eius-democracy-index/article33739128.ece) A similar index called the Freedom House Report, which labelled India has ‘partly free’ (a downgrade from ‘free’), was met with stark criticism by the government. It is important that we study the decisions taken by our legislators as well as the shift in India’s vox populi that have led these think tanks to their conclusions.

The National Security Act, a left-over piece of legislation from colonial India has been blatantly misused recently. Over 80% of all detainees under the NSA are released due to lack of evidence. 94% of all NSA detainees come from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, both of which are ruled by the same party that also rules the center. It is important to get political here, because there is a conclusive and certain correlation between the Bharatiya Janata Party and rising totalitarianism. The central government has over the years passed many draconian laws & amendments that include Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Bill, DNA Profiling Bill, Citizen Amendment Act, abrogation of Article 370, and the multiple Farm Bills.(https://www.cpiml.net/liberation/2019/07/draconian-and-anti-democratic-amendments-to-laws) In the year of 2020 itself, out of the 53 deaths in communal violence, 43 were confirmed Muslims. An arbitrarily high number of arrests due to communal violence have also been from the Muslim community, many stemming from the Delhi riots. 

Spokespersons from the ruling party BJP often champion the approval of the independent judiciary of India in these legislations. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hrr0rZLHqv0) It is important to analyse just how independent the judiciary really is. Since 2014, the Supreme Court has seen a rise in the number of judges taking early retirement for office posts and being closely involved in the decision making of some of the laws with the government. This is a shameful loophole in the constitution whence it describes the independence of the judiciary. Moreover, since its instantiation, the BJP government has amazingly witnessed a plethora of favourable decisions from the Supreme Court. From the Ram Mandir verdict to the court’s wilful ignorance of the CAA-NRC ordeal despite 140 pleas including those from a UN body it seems like a lot of the court’s verdicts have not only favoured the government, but also come at the right time.
