E2EE or End-to-End encryption is a type of communication system where the data is encrypted ‘end to end’, in other words, it is impossible for the system providers, third party eavesdroppers to access the information. In the case of messaging applications, it simply translates to the fact that only and only the sender and the receiver have access to the communication unless one of them were to actively breach this security. Signal, an open-source messaging app housed in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android), rose to fame during the scare created by new Whatsapp privacy policies. As the general population started realising Facebook’s growing privacy encroachment tactics, Signal saw widespread support owing to its non-profit, highly secure and open source nature. 
<br> 
<br>

However, with the induction of the new IT rules, Signal is identified as a Social media intermediary and has to comply with the rules formed by the government. Rules that many experts have deemed to be [disproportionate and unnecessary](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/messaging-application-signal-not-in-compliance-with-new-rules-say-officials-101624508925464.html). Compliance with these rules might put the very pride of the Signal App, its advanced security, at stake. The IT rules stipulate that a social media intermediary, which Signal is, has to submit routine records of activity on the platform and foster the ability to produce the originator of a widely circulated message when demanded to do so by the government. In essence, the end-to-end encryption of Signal is at stake. The government now wants not only the sender and receiver to have access to certain messages, but also the service provider Signal. 
<br> 
<br>

What remains uncertain is whether Signal will introduce a [‘backdoor’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)) for such privilege specifically for India or whether it will not comply all together. Needless to say, owing to Signal’s extensive open source reach, a backdoor like such will be quickly noticed and publicised. However, Signal doesn’t have too much to lose as long as it happens to be on the good side of US regulators and retain its United States non profit status. We witnessed Signal acting actively against the Iranian government following a ban of its application by [creating a proxy](https://signal.org/blog/help-iran-reconnect/).

<br>
> We hope that organizations and individuals will step up to run Signal TLS Proxy servers for Iranian users and help coordinate their distribution. We’re also continuing to investigate other techniques that are more automated and convenient. Iranian people deserve privacy. We hope this helps.
<br>

Therefore, we have reason to believe that it isnt entirely outside the realm of probability that Signal avoids compliance altogether and faces the regulatory consequences head-on. This is not improbable because Signal’s entire raison d’etre isits advanced encryption with [forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy), which will be compromised if it introduces a legal backdoor. Though the Guardian reported the existence of a backdoor in Whatsapp, the comprehensive [whitepaper](https://scontent.whatsapp.net/v/t39.8562-34/122249142_469857720642275_2152527586907531259_n.pdf/WA_Security_WhitePaper.pdf?ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2fbf2a&_nc_ohc=DnC7ZfGGeNgAX_o2kte&_nc_ht=scontent.whatsapp.net&oh=308f4ea2c6b267f5eca8cff2109ca292&oe=60E0CD99) last updated by Whatsapp in October 2020 reports that there is no backdoor present in the current version of Whatsapp.

Hence, Whatsapp and Signal alike are in grave danger with the policies. The difference as we noted is that India represents a huge marketplace for Facebook, and with rising access to the internet, continues to carry a lot of potential in terms of revenue, and Whatsapp is likely to comply with the policies in the event that they are actively enforced and enacted, whereas Signal can afford a non compliance. The now 8 years old Signal protocol, used by Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger and Signal itself is in danger. There have already been 8 court filings by litigators and professionals in the sphere challenging the constitutionality of the IT rules. The government and court’s actions with respect to the IT rules in the coming few days will decide the future of Whatsapp, Signal and encryption in India.
