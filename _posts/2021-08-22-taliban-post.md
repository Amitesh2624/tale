In 1965, People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) was founded by Mohammad Taraki and Babrak Karmal on the ideals of marxism and leninism. In its nascent stage, the party was able to secure 4 seats in the parliament that year, but mostly remained insignificant in the larger political scene at that time. Though a political minority, the PDPA helped former Prime-minister Mohammed Dawoud Khan overthrow the monarchy in 1973, and form The Republic of Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>
Khan was a mixed leader. Though his past policies, in the mid 1950s & 60s, granted women a greater public presence and the right to attend universities, he relentlessly cracked down on opposing forces and eliminated targets that he suspected were guilty of treason, without trial. Khan’s un-democratic ideals resulted in rising tensions between him and the PDPA, while the PDPA continued to militarise itself and conscript military personnel of its own. 
<br>
<br>
In April of 1978, a prominent left-leaning intellectual that enjoyed popular support from members of the PDPA, Mir Akbar Khyber was assassinated. Suspecting Khan’s involvement, the PDPA organised all of its military tools to carry out a coup d’etat on 27th April, 1978, assassinating Khan in the process. In the lack of new leadership, the previous leaders of PDPA, Mohammad Taraki and Babrak Karmal, the same people who had helped Khan overthrow the monarchy, took full control of the nation. Karmal and Taraki ascribed the deputy prime-minister and president roles to themselves, and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, under Socialist ideals, was born. 
<br>
<br>
The PDPA enjoyed close ties and funding from the USSR, and heavily armed itself for a prospective combat against the revolting Islamic-conservatist guerilla fighters which stood against the social changes. However, a rising communist leader, Hafizullah Amin established the Khalqist faction of the PDPA, opposed to Taraki’s & Karmal’s Parcham faction. Taraki was killed in a power-struggle orchestrated by Amin. Worried about the instability in the PDPA, and the rising Mujahideen (Islamic-conservationist) guerilla forces, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan on December 24, 1978. 
<br>
<br>
Amin was shortly thereafter executed by the Soviet forces, along with most of his followers. Karmal, the then deputy Prime-minister rose to leadership and power by taking the role of the Prime-minister, with Amin and Taraki dead. The Soviet Union continued its occupation of the land, to eliminate the Mujahideen forces, while they increased their military abilities. 
<br>
<br>
The prolonged war urged people to migrate to Pakistan and Iran in large numbers, while in 1984, the soon to be global threat, Osama bin Laden traveled to Afghanistan for the first time, to aid in the Mujahideen’s fight against Soviet forces. This was also the time of rising tensions in the Cold-war, and in an attempt to destabilise Soviet control in the state, the United States (and allies) supplied heavy arms and ammunition to the Mujahideen fighters. 
<br>
<br>
A group of 15 or so members under the leadership of Osama bin Laden found the Mujahideen group called ‘Al Qaida’, which aimed at furthering the islamist ideals and eliminating all retaliatory threat (at that time, the Soviet Union). 
<br>
<br>
The United States (and allies) struck a diplomatic treaty with the Soviet Union in 1988 to withdraw all of its troops from the Afghan region and a guaranteed independence to the Afghani people. Due to rising instability within the USSR itself, and growing revolt in its satellite states, the Soviet Union followed through with its end of the bargain and Soviet influence in Afghanistan massively reduced. 
<br>
<br>
In the following years, the Mujahideen movement continued to revolt against the communist leadership that was instituted during the Soviet Union’s departure, and the Afghani people faced trouble on a daily basis owing to a subsistence crisis caused by drought, famine and long years of internal war. A faction of the Mujahideen movement declared itself the Taliban, and guaranteed peace and prosperity to the Afghani people.
<br>
<br>
In the dire state that they were, the Afghani people approved of the Taliban movement and its support base grew. The Taliban illegalised cultivation of poppies for the opium trade, cracked down on crime, and curtailed the education and employment of women. Women were required to be fully veiled and were not allowed outside alone. Islamic law was enforced through public executions and amputations.
<br>
<br>
The Taliban publicly assassinated Najibullah, the communist president that the USSR left, and Al Qaida shifted its focus from the non-existent threat of the Soviets to the United States. Al Qaeda bombed 2 of the US’ embassies in Africa in 1995.
<br>
<br>
The United States demanded extradition and trial of bin Laden and levied heavy sanctions on Afghani trade, but to no avail. The Taliban rose to power, captured and held captive many international aid workers for allegedly propagating christianity, while bin Laden planned his next attack on the United States. 
<br>
<br>
In 2001, hijackers commandeered four commercial airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center Towers in New York, the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C., and a Pennsylvania field, killing thousands. Days later, U.S. officials deemed bin Laden, the Saudi exile believed to be hiding in Afghanistan, to be the prime suspect in the attack.
<br>
<br>
What followed in the next decade was a huge influx of NATO forces in the region, and a long relentless man-hunt for the perp, bin Laden. In 2011, bin Laden was found and killed by NATO forces. NATO forces gave control of the region and its security to the Afghan Army that was funded in part by NATO itself, and in 2016, Obama announced a time-table and a strategy to withdraw US forces from the land. However, Obama abandoned this plan and left 5500 US troops on Afghani land at the end of his tenure.
<br>
<br>
President Trump in 2019 signed a deal with the Taliban to withdraw all US armed forces from Afghanistan by 2021. POTUS Biden, 2 months late as per the deal, withdrew all of the States' forces and Taliban gains control of the land.
